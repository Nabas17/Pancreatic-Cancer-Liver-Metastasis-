# Pancreatic-Cancer-Liver-Metastasis-
A cohort of 12,955 incident pancreatic cancer patients was assembled from the Truveta platform. A subgroup of cases and controls that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria was analyzed using logistic regression and was reported as the primary analysis for this study. Effects on time to liver metastasis were also analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. The primary outcome was the occurrence of liver metastasis within 1 year of diagnosis. Subjects were categorized as having baseline metastasis (≤ 30 days from pancreatic cancer diagnosis) or post-baseline metastasis (>30 days). Demographic characteristics and comorbidities were evaluated for their potential role as risk factors.
